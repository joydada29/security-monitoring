3. Cybersecurity Log Analysis and Threat Detection

Overview: Performed comprehensive log analysis on Windows Server and Apache Web Server logs to identify threats, detect anomalies, and enhance security through optimized alert thresholds.

Objectives:
Investigated suspicious activities, such as failed and successful logins, deleted accounts, HTTP POST requests, and international traffic.
Analyzed HTTP methods, response codes, referrer domains, and user activity to uncover anomalies, including brute force attacks and account lockouts.
Used data-driven insights to fine-tune alert thresholds and improve detection accuracy.

Key Findings:
Identified suspicious login activity from User A and User K, with peak counts of 785 and 397 during critical periods.
Detected high HTTP POST activity originating from Ukraine, peaking at 1,297 requests, and associated with potential brute force attempts.
Highlighted vulnerable URIs, such as /VSI_Account_Logon.php, targeted during attacks.

Tools & Techniques: Utilized time chart visualizations, statistical dashboards, bar graphs, and cluster maps to correlate and visualize activity patterns effectively.

Outcomes:
Established effective thresholds for alerts to balance sensitivity and reduce false positives.
Demonstrated expertise in log analysis and identifying attack vectors across complex data sets.
